Bluzelle DB as a web server demo

Notes:
* files in the /site directory get uploaded to the database
* file-uploader.ts uploads all files in the /site directory to the db
* server.ts updates the dynamic data portion of the demo (just a timestamp)
* The url to see the site is /crud/raw/[uuid]/[file].  This example has been uploaded 
to https://client.sentry.testnet.private.bluzelle.com:1317/crud/raw/my-sitex/index.html
